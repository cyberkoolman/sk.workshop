My father, a respected resident of Milan, was a close friend of a merchant named Beaufort who, after a series of
misfortunes, moved to Zurich in poverty. My father was upset by his friend's troubles and sought him out,
finding him in a mean street. Beaufort had saved a small sum of money, but it was not enough to support him and
his daughter, Mary. Mary procured work to eek out a living, but after ten months her father died, leaving
her a beggar. My father came to her aid and two years later they married.
